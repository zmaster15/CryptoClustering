## Introduction
This project is the eleventh coding module challenge that we had to complete as part of the Denver University AI Bootcamp coursework. 

The initial code provided for the challenge had us work with a CSV file for all currently traded crypto currencies, ingest it and then run it through unsupervised learning models to gauge cluster groupings. We used two specific Unsupervised learning models (KMeans & Principal Component Analysis) on the dataset. The module had us use these models to identify the best K-value via an elbow curve chart. Additionally, we also looked at the variance between the answers and were able to determine the weights of each feature on each principal component. 


## Installation Requirements
*Requirements*: You must run Python 3.12.7 to execute the code as the code uses match case sytax that is older versions of python will not recognize.

## Usage
Anyone that would like to understand how to use Unsupervised learning models to determine which is the best K-value to use to identify cluster groupings and finally determine feature weaights that would have the highest / lowest influence on each principal component.  

## License
I've included the MIT License to encourage collaboration and use by the community.

## Acknowledgement / Contributing
Thank to the guidance of the Denver University AI Bootcamp Teachers Assistant's and their hints via comments that helped me complete this assignment. Without this I would've been completely lost. 

While a section of this code was written by the Denver University AI Bootcamp Teachers Assistant, it has been modified / completed by me.
